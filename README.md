# Pseudomonas-Final-Project

Very easy to run! Download the files result.csv and Stubenvoll_CS466_FinalProject.ipynb, then open Stubenvoll_CS466_FinalProject.ipynb in a jupyter notebook now you can run the cells! Any modules needed to run the notebook should have commands to install them via pip in the notebook. If you don't have pip installed, just download the modules separately into you python installation so that they are available for use.

All of the pdfs are uploaded for ease of access, but can be recreated by running the jupyter notebook cells.
