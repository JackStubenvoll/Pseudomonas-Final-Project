# Pseudomonas-Final-Project

Very easy to run! Download the files result.csv and Stubenvoll_CS466_FinalProject.ipynb, then open Stubenvoll_CS466_FinalProject.ipynb in a jupyter notebook now you can run the cells! Any modules needed to run the notebook should have commands to install them via pip in the notebook. If you don't have pip installed, just download the modules separately into you python installation so that they are available for use.

All of the pdfs are uploaded for ease of access, but can be recreated by running the jupyter notebook cells. 

For reference:
- all pdfs with 'allSamples' as a prefix include the mutations that are 'shared_subclonal' in the phylogeny.
- all pdfs with 'clonal' only allow clonal mutations in the phylogeny, while 'clonalSubclonal' allows subclonal mutations.
- the final part of the pdf name is either yesHomoplasy or noHomoplasy, indicating whether there can be more than one edge for a given mutation in the phylogeny.
